Trinity is a modern C++ information-retrieval library for building queries, indexing documents and other content, running queries and scoring documents matching them.

Please check [the wiki](https://github.com/phaistos-networks/Trinity/wiki) for documentation. There is barely any documentation for now (though I encourage you to check the codebase comments),  but this will change once I can find the time to improve the situation.

Trinity is developed by [Phaistos Networks, S.A](http://phaistosnetworks.gr/)
